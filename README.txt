This MATLAB script will track the colours placed on the fingers and according to the data received, it will move the mouse pointer across the screen
The clicking function can be enabled( or disabled ) by commenting ( or uncommenting ) the jRobot's mousepress function in the code.

The code will not work if there are multiple objects of the same color ( blue ) are detected on the screen!
